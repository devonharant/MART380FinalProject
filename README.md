# MART380FinalProject
final video game project made for New Media Art class Spring of 2021

THIS REPO DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL THE FILES NEEDED FOR THE PROJECT TO RUN IN UNITY

The project file was too large to upload to this repo so I have included the, what I consider to be, essential files pertaining to the project.

This project was made using Unity 2019.4.18f1 as well as the free DOTween assets/plugins downloaded from the Unity In-Engine store.

Here is the link to the game posted online:

Music in game is from:
https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Breuss_Arrizabalaga_Quintet/Nfamoudou-Boudougou/05_-_breuss_arrizabalaga_quintet_-_mount_fuji 

All other sounds were created by myself.
